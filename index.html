        <p>Kurdistan, Arabic Kurdistān, Persian Kordestān, broadly defined geographic region traditionally inhabited mainly by Kurds. It consists of an extensive plateau and mountain area, spread over large parts of what are now eastern Turkey, northern Iraq, and western Iran and smaller parts of northern Syria and Armenia. Two of these countries officially recognize internal entities by this name: Iran’s northwestern province of Kordestān and Iraq’s Kurdish autonomous region.
    
    The Kurdistan (“Land of the Kurds”) designation refers to an area of Kurdish settlement that roughly includes the mountain systems of the Zagros and the eastern extension of the Taurus. Since ancient times the area has been the home of the Kurds, a people whose ethnic origins are uncertain. For 600 years after the Arab conquest and their conversion to Islam, the Kurds played a recognizable and considerable part in the troubled history of western Asia—but as tribes, individuals, or turbulent groups rather than as a people.</p>

                              The Canyon of Rawanduz Valley is in my opinion the most beautiful place in Iraqi Kurdistan.
                     
                              There are several viewpoints from which you can see the incredible beauty of Rawanduz.
                              
                              If you have more time than visiting the viewpoints, you can hike in the Valley of Rawanduz
